An archive of codes for course if Artificial Life Simulation, done in Python.

It has implementations of Simulation algorithms like Artificial Potential Field,
Social Potential Field, and many more algorithms being applied to simulation
of swarm robots.

It also has assignment being done over the TurtleSim simulator, with the
implementation being done following the Publisher-Subsscriber model.
